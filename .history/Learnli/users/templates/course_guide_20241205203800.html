            LearnLi Course Content Moderation Guidelines and Policies
            Version: 1.0
            Effective Date: [Insert Date]
            
            Introduction
            LearnLi, as an academic platform, upholds the highest standards of content integrity, educational value, and compliance with international academic and online publishing regulations. To maintain the trust of our users and ensure a safe, inclusive, and enriching learning environment, a robust content moderation system is vital. This document outlines the policies, guidelines, and procedures for moderating course content, specifying what content is deemed flaggable, inappropriate, and grounds for removal. It also defines when flagged content should be approved, rejected, or escalated to reviewers.
            
            The goal is to ensure clarity for moderators while preserving the integrity of content creators and protecting user rights.
            
            Guiding Principles
            Educational Integrity: Content should align with educational purposes and learning objectives.
            Inclusivity and Respect: Content must respect all users regardless of race, religion, gender, or background.
            Compliance with Laws: Courses must adhere to international laws regarding copyright, intellectual property, and privacy.
            Transparency: Moderation decisions should be clear, consistent, and justifiable.
            Escalation for Ambiguities: Moderators must escalate cases where violations are unclear or borderline.
            Flaggable and Inappropriate Content
            Categories of Flaggable Content
            Content uploaded on LearnLi may be flagged for the following reasons:
            
            Harmful or Offensive Content:
            
            Hate speech, discriminatory language, or targeted harassment.
            Graphic violence, explicit sexual content, or glorification of harm.
            Academic Violations:
            
            Plagiarized materials or uncredited work.
            Inaccurate or falsified educational content.
            Content that promotes academic dishonesty, such as cheating guides.
            Misinformation:
            
            Courses spreading unverified or false information in critical fields (e.g., health, finance, legal topics).
            Intellectual Property Infringement:
            
            Unauthorized use of copyrighted materials.
            Misleading Content:
            
            Titles, descriptions, or visuals that misrepresent the course content.
            Technical Violations:
            
            Broken files, unreadable formats, or incomplete uploads.
            Degrees of Inappropriateness
            The degree of a violation determines whether flagged content is approved, rejected, or escalated:
            
            Low Degree (Minor Issues):
            
            Typos, minor factual errors, or slightly outdated references.
            Does not compromise educational value or user trust.
            Action: Approve the flag but request updates or corrections.
            Moderate Degree (Borderline Inappropriate):
            
            Potentially offensive but contextually relevant (e.g., historical analysis of controversial topics).
            Ambiguities in intellectual property claims.
            Action: Escalate to a reviewer.
            High Degree (Severe Violations):
            
            Explicitly harmful, offensive, or illegal content.
            Plagiarized work or blatant misinformation.
            Action: Reject the content and remove it immediately.
            Procedures for Moderation Actions
            Approval of Flagged Content
            
            When to Approve:
            The flagged content does not meet any defined flaggable criteria.
            The flag stems from a misunderstanding or over-sensitivity without clear grounds for violation.
            Steps:
            Approve the content with an explanation to the flagging user.
            Mark the case as resolved.
            Rejection of Flagged Content
            
            When to Reject:
            Content clearly violates flaggable criteria at a moderate or high degree.
            Steps:
            Notify the content creator of the rejection with a detailed explanation.
            Allow the creator to appeal within [set time, e.g., 7 days].
            Escalation to Reviewer
            
            When to Escalate:
            The moderator cannot confidently determine the severity or appropriateness.
            Content falls in a grey area requiring expert judgment.
            Steps:
            Escalate the case with detailed notes and supporting evidence.
            Notify the flagger and the creator of the escalation.
            Case Assignments and Procedures
            To ensure an efficient and transparent workflow, cases are categorized and assigned based on content type and violation severity:
